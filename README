# comments: 
- I added line 285 in order to stop the ETL from erroring
- after setting up the EC2 instance, I added an admin and two cities: Austin and Dallas
- added user3.json file which has the same username as user.json (username = "User1") but a different password (password = "1")
- I just manually added the /data directory due to the error with the ETL not being able to create one
